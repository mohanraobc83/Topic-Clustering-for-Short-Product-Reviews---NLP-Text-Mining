# Topic-Clustering-for-Short-Product-Reviews---NLP-Text-Mining
The objective of the project is to develop a code which will help in clustering the short product reviews into groups of similar reviews.
Then manually review the reviews in each cluster to understand the topic being discussed and label the cluster with relavant name based on the topic discussed
Then add the sentiment score to each review
4 different topic clustering methods were used to make sure we get the right topic groupings
1. LDA
2. LSA
3. NMF
4. K-Means

TextBlob package was used to do the sentiment scoring

User has the additional manual task to read the reviews in each cluster and label them accordingly
  1. This activity is a one time task 
  2. Once label is complete, this data set can be used as learning data set and a predictive model can be trained on it
  3. Any new review can be alssified automatically using the model developed
